# Final Project Repository

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of our final project, including neural networks (NN), genetic algorithms (GA), Stacking, and other machine learning models.

### Files:
- **NN_GA_combined.ipynb**: The complete Jupyter Notebook implementing both NN and GA for the final project.
- **NN.ipynb**: Contains the implementation of neural networks and genetic algorithms.
- **xgb.ipynb**: Includes the code for training the XGBoost (XGB) model.
- **bdt.ipynb**: Contains the training code for the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) model.
- **MDS_plot.png**: The MDS plot visualizing signals and backgrounds, used for initial data analysis in the milestone.
- **run.py**: Includes logistic regression code used in the milestone.
- **stacking_implementation.ipynb**: Contains the implementation of stacking.
- **validate_results.ipynb**: Contains code for calculating mean and variance of signal significance of stacking model predictions.

This repository serves as a comprehensive implementation of different machine learning approaches used in our final project.
